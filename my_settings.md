## My settings

I put my reasons for changing the setting between parenthesis

- Windows > Preferences > General > Editors > Text Editors > Spelling
  - Uncheck _Enable spell checking_
    (gets rid of all the red curly underlinings)
  - Apply and Close >
- Windows > Preferences > C/C++ > Editor > Folding >
  - Uncheck _Comments_
    (comments are put in to read, not to hide)
  - Apply and Close >
- Windows > Preferences > C/C++ > Code Analysis >
  - Uncheck _Suggested parenthesis around expression_
    (it's no fun reading too many parenthesis)
  - Apply and Close >
- Windows > Preferences > C/C++ > Code Analysis >
  - Uncheck _Suspicious semicolon_
    (for empty statements I like to write ` ;` in stead of `{ ;}`)
  - Apply and Close >
